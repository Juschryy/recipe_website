    <h2>Description</h2>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 duck legs</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup water, or as needed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups diced yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>6 cups chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
        <li>⅔ cup pomegranate molasses</li>
        <li>¼ cup honey</li>
        <li>3 cups walnut halves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season duck legs all over with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. Place duck legs, skin-side down, in hot oil and cook until browned, 2 to 5 minutes. Turn and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 4 minutes. Transfer legs to a plate; pour rendered duck fat into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour water into the skillet and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Place about 2 tablespoons duck fat into a Dutch oven; add olive oil and heat over medium heat until hot. Add onion and sauté until golden brown, 7 to 10 minutes. Add turmeric, cinnamon, and nutmeg; cook and stir until fragrant, 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken broth, pomegranate molasses, honey, and reserved water mixture from the skillet into the Dutch oven; bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, grind walnuts to a fine powder in a food processor.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir ground walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes; stir into broth mixture.</li>
        <li>Place duck legs into broth and press gently to submerge. Reduce the heat and simmer until duck legs are no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 3 to 4 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring broth to a boil; cook until reduced and desired sauce consistency is reached. Season with salt. Ladle sauce over duck legs to serve.</li>
    </ol>
